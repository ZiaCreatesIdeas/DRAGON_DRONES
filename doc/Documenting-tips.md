There is a trade of between memory retention duration and screen space.  
If users have two screens, then great.  
Dropbox does not have a hot key for pause, nor rewind. Both are important for lessons.  
Punch is handy.  
Blender does have a way to play movies within interface. 
Share X has capture Screen guides.  
gif's repeat - useful for single steps. 
Dropbox - should either repeat every action twice. Or allow pause.  
Maybe video overview on top, then step by step break down below and slim.
I wish there was a way to slow down the drop box videos.User side. 
Ulitimately, it looks like yt has a better feature set.
